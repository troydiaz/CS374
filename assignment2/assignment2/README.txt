/*
*   INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPILE, RUN, AND CHECK FOR MEMORY LEAKS!!!
*   Process the file provided as an argument to the program to
*   create a linked list of student structs and print out the list.
*   Compile the program as follows:
*       make clean && make
*   Run the executable:
*       ./main
*   Check for any memory leaks:
*       make clean && make
*       valgrind --leak-check=full ./main
*   To check for directories:
*       Each directory will be named "diaztr.movies.<random_num>"
*       And in each directory there will be file(s) named "<year>.txt"
*   For testing:
*       movies_1.csv is the largest file
*       movies_2.csv is the smallest file
*       specific.csv is for testing getSpecificFile()
*   Remove junk from your directory:
*       To remove all directories/files made from this program 
*       use this command rm -rf diaztr.movies.*
